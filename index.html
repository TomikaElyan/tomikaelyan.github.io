            <p>

What if a feather could whisper your name?

Liana lives in a quiet cottage where nothing ever happens—until the day a glowing feather floats through her window and leads her into the heart of a magical forest.

There, maps sing, stars fade, and trials of courage await.

Joined by a silent cat and a grumbling gnome, Liana must follow the feather’s path to save a forest that remembers everything—and to discover the quiet strength hidden inside herself.

This gentle fantasy adventure is perfect for kids ages 8–12 who love magical forests, emotional stories, and quiet, powerful heroines.

If you’re looking for middle grade fantasy books with talking animals, starry wonder, and lyrical storytelling—this chapter book will stay with you long after the last page.

                <h2>About the Author</h2>
                <p>Tomika Elyan was born and raised in Ukraine, a land of rich traditions and quiet strength. When the war began, she emigrated to the United Kingdom with her young son, carrying with her not only memories of home, but also a deep well of creativity that no hardship could silence.

Her debut children’s book, Liana and the Whispering Forest, is just the beginning of a vibrant literary journey. Tomika is currently working on a series of children’s stories, interactive adventure books, and a heartfelt Ukrainian cookbook that blends heritage with warmth.

Through her writing, she continues to weave light, resilience, and imagination — for children, families, and anyone in need of a gentle story.</p>
